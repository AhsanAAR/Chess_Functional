# Chess_Console
 Complete chess game made with functional programming and console output only


Using the goToRowCol function I was able to draw the board and pieces. The whole game is built over the console and all display is made my refreshing the board. All moves including stalemate, promotion, castling are included. Load, save and undo are also coded.
